        <h2>Teahouse-inspired Zen Pods</h2>
        <p>Each room in the hotel is a pod (capsule-type accommodation) and guests can choose from various bed sizes and pod styles. Each pod is designed in accordance with Japanese traditional design disciplines, with touches of wabi-sabi, Japanese version of minimalistic design that appreciates small spaces and natural materials.
