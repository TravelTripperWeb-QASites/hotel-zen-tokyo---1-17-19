People typically bring bento to work/school and on day trips. Making bento has traditionally been a woman&rsquo;s job in the household, and many Japanese wives make bento for their husbands and children. Women in relationships sometimes prepare a bento for a significant other during their courtship, particularly during hanami (花見- cherry blossom viewing)season for an outdoor picnic.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">What goes in a bento?&nbsp;</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many apply the 4 parts carb: 2 parts protein: 1 part vegetable: 1 part fruit ratio when packing bento. The packing of most bento begins with rice, the main staple of Japan. Depending on the region, some bento may emphasize potatoes or other kinds of rice. Most bento use Japanese white rice and often season it with furikake, a dry seasoning of sesame seeds, chopped seaweed, sugar, salt and dried fish, or some other topping.</p>\n<blockquote><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-63ccc5d8-7fff-a178-d914-d43b7dc07846\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><img style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0rad); display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/MB3FKj13QgxHrt0vBTTz0NySCJWbD8pSU-pKu12w7qWThFjNMt9_EXVFBpZuryzR1gAcKziLr46o8sWSnaNoYrqnD1AemQDy7RLbioL4GBIETZAn2Oj8C2tSKoknrMqNalG4-ArM\" width=\"483\" height=\"362\" /></span></span>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">A typical bento - main part is rice, with 4 parts cab: 2 parts protein: 1 part vegetable: 1 part fruit (INSERT COPYRIGHT SAFE IMAGE)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The next component is protein. Protein options include meats, fish, tofu, eggs, beans, to name a few. Usually mothers try to incorporate two kinds of protein dishes in the meal. Fruits and vegetables are used to pack the remainder of the box. Again, try to incorporate at least two kinds of vegetables and a few pickles. If space is a premium, pack the fruit in a separate container. Silicon wrappers and little containers can help keep components separated and foods dry until they are going to be eaten.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is also important to consider color when assembling a bento; traditionally, Japanese meals are supposed to have five colors in them and color variety is a good way to ensure the meal is healthier. Make sure the food is packed tightly to prevent food shifting in transit. Most bento are enjoyed room temperature hours after assembly. Eating food at room temperature is common in Japan and most bento boxes are not insulated or made to be microwave-safe.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Etymology of &ldquo;Bento&rdquo;</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Japanese characters for bento (弁当) have the same phonetic pronunciation as the Chinese word 便當, which essentially means convenience. The word for transportable, packed meals came from China during the Heian period (794-1185), but by the Momoyama period (1583-1600), the Japanese spelling of &ldquo;bento&rdquo; had replaced the Chinese. The integration of &ldquo;bento&rdquo; into the vernacular is often attributed to Oda Nobunaga (1534-82), a powerful lord who is regarded as one of the three unifiers of Japan. Nobunaga often distributed food to large numbers of people at his castle so that they would not have to go home to eat.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-16e39b9a-7fff-1579-ab56-e6e1ebcfe573\"><img style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0rad); display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/McgerdtSqOpGV3ddmNJL-GSkGRCTHXT8PvM5cEJJuzpXR_czeHT6Bk4OhB2TwKqqyDiPzkigO8vCfspsDWnsWLm3b1GGO0FebaLokBn98TpLnCSEvBYhrBFudc7sToiqkrTUm_4q\" width=\"208\" height=\"243\" /></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Oda Nobunaga</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">PHOTO</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Early Bento History</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though bento has a Chinese origin, Japanese have been eating packed meals since the fifth century. In the Nihon-shoki (日本書紀 -the Chronicles of Japan, and the 2nd oldest book of classical Japanese history), there are accounts of nobles bringing packed lunches for a day of falconry. Literature from the Heian period includes scenes with travelers stopping to eat dried boiled rice and other prepared foods on their journeys. Early Japanese literature and historical records focused on the lives of nobles, but traditionally anyone working outdoors (farmers, soldiers, fishermen, etc.) brought lunches with them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">PHOTO</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">During the Edo era (1603-1868), the consumption of bento extended beyond utility and became an essential accompaniment for a day outdoors or at the theater. The makunouchi bento (幕の内弁当), which typically consists of small, sesame-sprinkled rice balls and an assortment of okazu, is an Edo era product. The bento gets its name from the intermission between acts of a play, and theatergoers continue to eat bento during intermissions. Other Edo era bento inventions include the onigiri (おにぎり), a triangular rice ball wrapped in seaweed and typically filled with plum or fish, now a mainstay of Japanese lunches and snack foods.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-e210963f-7fff-87ed-3e27-f0e9d29186f1\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><img style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0rad); display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4qx-FLKaWem3wRUjapqUYQzX-svCJT9QYXIKRiz4QgzPQpKbS4D318IomYDK8Gl9n94P6yDY98XI382YkF6xjA_DmU2DZ5u4GSHhC628UwYUvJNqBa_9tOe6Gf9RXxHI_HxohaXD\" width=\"495\" height=\"213\" /></span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">the Nihon-shoki (日本書紀 | the Chronicles of Japan)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-f302c98e-7fff-56b6-9b6f-4171e6fdb81d\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Verdana; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><img style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/8zRNRvgKu4tis8pvJ9NUeS7bTdMvcqdIyH3gfg10cVMCaBsOMlseD_nzfdiRY-BPmNDT-SV-RDMOisPnUMqLCTw6nikh_opZciI0nJL4P7-bLT0hLnbcAYUasmMF9sgnO4WW1laY\" width=\"368\" height=\"245\" /></span></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">a typical bento, where fish, a fried shrimp, an egg omelet and various vegetables can be found neatly compartmentalized</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bento and Industrialization: the Ekiben</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Japan was forced to end its 250-year policy of isolation at the end of the Edo period, ushering in an age of rapid industrialization during the Meiji period (1868-1912). One hallmark of the Meiji period is the construction of the Japanese railway system. With the advent of train travel came the ekiben (駅弁), a bento purchased at a train station. Ekiben remain an essential part of travel in Japan today though people eat them on bullet trains instead of locomotives. Ekiben also became a way for areas to showcase local specialties. Some of the best restaurants in cities will often create an exclusive ekiben.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">PHOTO</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shin-Osaka station&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hakkaku Bento&rdquo; has been sold for decades in its distinctive octagonal box, showcasing Kansai-style seasoning and preparation. Tokyo is known for tonkatsu (deep fried pork cutlets) and one of the city&rsquo;s most established tonkatsu restaurants, Maisen, offers a popular katsudon ekiben (カツど pork cutlet over rice) in Tokyo station. The Echizen Kanimeshi bento (かにめし弁当) available for purchase in the Fukui prefecture consists of rice steamed with ovaries and innards of female snow crabs then topped with a generous serving of flaked crabmeat. Ekiben are also very affordable, with most costing between 800 and 1200 yen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-9596d09e-7fff-9675-4c37-82e0cb637681\"><img style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/D0RJplO-urAlCjSLzSFODMCJsWsLjFaXgWnYFj-fk54hQgRu1pXPMyckVzlUIarxu65HXbUDHZJny64WhmSY633bvnVfLabC00M53kElEslOe5MN-fBxjanbB1H1xx6_TG9-P0XH\" width=\"259\" height=\"194\" /></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">a Sagano ekiben (courtesy of Ryosuke Hosoi);</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-46fd984f-7fff-e7c3-b416-38c65e898676\"><img style=\"border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Q8tImqqnouj3KwFkHEwl23lBHc_Fb00APed8bOfhbWn5gDHWUQ5xNILfg2G4rV9J1LXot5IbUWAKkQ7foRhxbO8IGM5BBg-zqk7-qUEWJpdBWGIoCM_mpvFh-XhC2AQIUFjx2CBJ\" width=\"259\" height=\"194\" /></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">an Ashikawa station ekiben (courtesy of shirokazan)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Picnic-Packing: Koraku bento (子楽弁当)</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Koraku bento, or &ldquo;picnic lunchbox,&rdquo; are large bento made to be shared by a small group. Koraku bento are usually packed in a large box and filled with seasonal dishes. The contents of a koraku bento during hanami season, when people picnic to enjoy the blooming of the cherry blossoms, are different from the contents of koraku bento packed for an autumnal outing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bento for Children: Kyara-ben</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many Japanese children bring bento to school until they start eating standard school lunches in middle school and high school. Pressure on mothers to make bento appealing to preschool and kindergarten aged children has elevated the standards of a homemade packed lunch.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bentobako (弁当箱) are lacquer (traditional) or plastic (more recent) bento boxes that have compartments for rice and various okazu. Parents purchase themed bentobako decorated with cute cartoon characters to get children extra excited about lunch. More recently, the advent of the kyara-ben, bento with food made to look like Studio Ghibli&rsquo;s Totoro, Pokemon and other cute characters, has increased pressure on mothers to make nutritious and visually kawai (可愛い cute) lunches.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&lt;INSERT KYARA-BEN PHOTO&gt;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some Japanese mothers attend classes to learn how to make the extra elaborate and enticing kyara-ben. In these classes, women learn how to shape rice into characters and make facial features from seaweed, crab sticks and various other ingredients. Constructing kyara-ben often requires the assistance of toothpicks and other utensils to make sure the details are applied correctly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Getting up earlier to make kyara-ben or standard cute bento might sound a bit crazy, but many mothers feel that the extra effort gets children to eat nutritionally balanced meals and stave off picky eating habits. Japanese children eat grilled or raw fish and steamed vegetables for lunch without complaint, fostering better food habits than a PB&amp;J. Japanese childhood obesity levels are among the lowest in the developed world, and while other habits, like walking to school instead of being dropped off, factor into the overall healthiness of kids, nutritious lunches are integral.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The bento process may seem a bit extreme, but eating a nutritionally balanced lunch is critical for keeping energy levels high for the rest of the day. The packing of multiple kinds of dishes likely seems a bit unnecessary to foreigners but is indicative of how Japanese people cook and eat at home. Anchored by rice and miso soup, most meals consist of a few kinds of vegetable or protein-focused okazu, so bento are a great way to make use of leftovers.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bento Faux Pas</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In Japan, people generally refrain from eating in public or walking and eating. If you want to enjoy a bento outside, it&rsquo;s best to go to a park or find an outdoor table. Ekiben are reserved for long train rides. On shinkansen (bullet trains), there are trays and cup holders at every seat. If the train you are riding does not have trays, do not eat on it. Eating and drinking on the subway, with the exception of discreetly sipping water or iced tea, is considered extremely rude. Streets and public transportation are clean for a reason.&nbsp;</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Beyond Lunchtime: Bento Boxes and Japanese Architecture</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The efficiently compartmentalized bento box has more in common with Japanese architecture than might first meet the eye: both prioritize maximizing space. An architecture firm run by a Japanese woman and American man made headlines for renovating a NYC apartment with a bento box inspiration (<a title=\"Bento and Architecture to renovate an NYC apartment\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/greathomesanddestinations/04location.html\">link</a>). Boston&rsquo;s McCormick Gallery held an exhibit in 2015 titled &ldquo;Obento and Built Space: Japanese Boxed Lunch and Architecture&rdquo; showcasing cases where architects have been inspired by bento design (<a title=\"Bento and Architecture exhibition\" href=\"https://the-bac.edu/experience-the-bac/news-and-events/events/bento-and-architecture-exhibition-event\">link</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
